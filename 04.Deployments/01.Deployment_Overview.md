Deployment is more sophisticated form of replica set with one additional feature, with deployment we get rolling updates with zero downtime.

deployment.yaml
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: webapp-replicaset
spec:
  minReadySeconds: 30
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webapp
  replicas: 2
  templates: # template for the pods
    metadata:
      labels:
      app: webapp
    spec: 
      containers:
      - name: webapp
        image: richardchesterwood/k8s-fleetman-webapp-angular:release0-5
 ```
 ```
 kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
