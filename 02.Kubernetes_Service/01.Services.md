Pods are not visible outside the cluster.

Service is a long running object in k8's. The service will have an IP address and service will have stable fixed pods.
We can attach services to pods.

webapp-service.yaml
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: fleetman-webapp

spec: 
  # This defines which pods are going to be represented by this service
  # The service becomes a network endpoint for either other services or maybe external users to connect to (eg browser)
  selector: 
    app: webapp
    
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30008
  
  type: NodePort
```

Types of service:
1. Cluster IP: Used within the cluster. A internal service to inside the cluster
2. Load Balancer: supported by cloud providers
3. NodePort: Expose the port through the node. We can choose what node-port can exposed. k8s allow us to use port greater than 30000

```
kubectl apply -f webapp-service.yaml
```
```
kubectl get all
```
